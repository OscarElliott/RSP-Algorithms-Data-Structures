# RSP-Algorithms-Data-Structures
Data structures and algorithms implementations I coded during RSP

## Implementations 
- [x] Linked List.
- [ ] A Binary Tree.
- [ ] A Graph using an Adjacency List.
- [ ] Depth First Search.
- [ ] Breadth First Search. 

## Testing
All code implementations can be tested by using the driver file which runs a basic and dirty Unit test checking for expected functionality.
